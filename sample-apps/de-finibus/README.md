This is a sample app. It doesn't do much useful for now, just displays chunks
of Cicero's book "De finibus bonorum et malorum".

## Serving the App

To serve it, first install http-server:

    sudo npm install http-server -g

Then run http-server it:

    http-server www

(You can also use any other HTTP server.)

## Loading the Data

In order for the app to display some data, you will need to load articles
contained in the "data" directory. See README.txt in that directory for
instructions.
